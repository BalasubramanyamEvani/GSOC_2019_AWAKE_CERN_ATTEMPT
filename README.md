This repository contains my prelims and final submissions to CERN-AWAKE project for 2019 GSOC, though it was not accepted, it may prove to be helpful for other candidates who are aspiring 
for GSOC, to understand the format in which the submissions are to be made. I was able to clear the prelims and based on my final submission I was also selected for a video interview with
respective mentors.
